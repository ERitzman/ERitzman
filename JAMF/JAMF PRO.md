* Once an instance is created, the Jamf Pro Setup Assistant must be completed before the server is ready for use.
* The Jamf Pro license agreement must be accepted in order to complete the Setup Assistant and start using Jamf Pro.
* The organization name is shown on all enrolled devices.
	- This name does not have to exactly match the name of the organization that purchased Jamf Pro.
* A Jamf Pro activation code can be retrieved from [account.jamf.com](https://account.jamf.com) by navigating to Jamf Account >> Products >> Jamf Pro.
* Create a local Jamf Pro user account to log in to the server for the first time.
	- Additional accounts can be created later for other users.
	- Itâ€™s strongly recommended to keep at least one local administrator account active.
	- An email address can be added to receive notifications from your Jamf Pro server; this requires integration with an SMTP server.
* For assistance with any issues, visit Jamf Account at [account.jamf.com](https://account.jamf.com) and click the question mark button (?) in the top-right corner.
