# PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer
(Exam PCEP-30-0x)

PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification shows that the individual is familiar with universal computer programming concepts like data types, containers, functions, conditions, loops, as well as Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.

**PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification (Exam PCEP-30-0x)** is a professional credential that measures the candidate's ability to accomplish coding tasks related to the essentials of programming in the Python language. A test candidate should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the universal concepts of computer programming, the syntax and semantics of the Python language, as well as the skills in resolving typical implementation challenges with the help of the Python Standard Library.

The PCEP™ certification shows that the individual is familiar with the following concepts: fundamental **terms and definitions** (e.g. compilation vs. interpretation), Python's **logic and structure** (e.g. keywords, instructions, indentation), **literals**, **variables**, and **numeral systems**, **operators and data types**, **I/O operations**, **control flow** mechanisms (conditional blocks and loops), **data collections** (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings), **functions** (decomposition, built-in and user-defined functions, organizing interaction between functions and their environment, generators, recursion), **exceptions** (exception handling, hierarchies), as well as the essentials of Python programming language **syntax**, **semantics**, and the **runtime environment**.

Becoming PCEP™ certified ensures that the individual is acquainted with the most essential means provided by Python 3 to enable them to start their own studies at an intermediate level, and to continue their professional development.

PCEP™ certification is an interim step to the PCAP™ certification, and the starting point to launch a career in software development, Python programming, and related technologies. Becoming PCEP™ certified helps certification holders stand out from other candidates, get a foot in the door with an employer, and land a junior-level job in the IT sector and anywhere the basic knowledge of Python is an asset.
