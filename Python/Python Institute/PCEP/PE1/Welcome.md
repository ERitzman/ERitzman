# Welcome to Python Essentials 1
This course is the **first in a 2-course series** that will prepare you for the [PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) and [PCAP: Certified Associate in Python Programming certification](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap) exams.

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to **design**, **write**, **debug**, and **run** programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the **basic concepts of software development technology**.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood **software development**, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer **systems design** and **software testing**.

## Course Syllabus
In this course you will learn:
- the universal concepts of computer programming;
- the syntax and semantics of the Python language;
- practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges;
- how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library;
- how to install your runtime environment;
- how to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.

The course is divided into 4 modules:

### Module 1
Introduction to Python and computer programming;
### Module 2
Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, and basic operators;
### Module 3
Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical and bitwise operations;
### Module 4
Functions, tuples, dictionaries, exceptions, and data processing.

## Why should you learn PYTHON?
Python is omnipresent, and many people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There have been millions (well, actually billions) of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What's more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.

There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:
- It is easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster;
- It is easy to use for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;
- It is easy to obtain, install and deploy - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.

Completing this course can be a stepping-stone to learning any other programming language, and to exploring technologies using Python as a foundation (e.g., Django). The course is distinguished by its affordability, friendliness, and openness to the student.

The first part starts from the absolute basics, guiding you step-by-step to complex problems explained in part 2, making you a responsible software creator able to take on different challenges in many positions in the IT industry.

## Where do you use Python?
Do you remember Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield Heroes - strategy and first person shooter games from EA DICE? All the games use Python for logic and server controls. Python is frequently used for creating open-source, free games, e.g., OpenRTS, PySol, Metin 2, or Frets On Fire - famous Guitar Hero-like games written in pygame.

And what about the major websites and services? Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python. Other examples?
- Internet Applications (BitTorrent, Jogger Publishing Assistant, TheCircle, TwistedMatrix)
- 3D CAD/CAM (FreeCAD, Fandango, Blender, Vintech RCAM)
- Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)
- Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)
- Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)
- Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)
- Personal Information Managers (BitPim, Narval, Prioritise, Task Coach, WikidPad)</br>

Generally, Python is a great choice for:
- Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
- Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
- Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
- Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
- Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
- Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)</br>

And many, many other projects and development tools.
