## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Erik Ritzman and this is my GitHub Repository serving to introduce myself and to introduce to others what I am working on as well as to serve as a POR for my personal endeavors and notes.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about the use of Git and it's many functions/abilities. Within this learning I am also attempting to use Git to manage my daily note taking in lieu of OneNote.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am avialable via email [eritzman@gmail.com](mailto:eritzman@gmail.com)

- âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from being a Support Technician and Cybersecurity Analyst, I am also a professional photographer and enjoy the opportunity to share with others the joy of capturing and working with light within the realm of photography. I specialize in portrait and themed photography, often finding new and unique ways to create special effects without the use of photoshop (in camera). My Photography site can be found at [LSStudios.photo]((https://www.lsstudios.photo/)
